# Creative-project


I just realised that when importing my project to github i left out the public file. I added in a new one, so that the code could be run in the GitHub preview. i was unsure if i should delte the old html file since i cant move it. to prove i havnet changed anything in the html file ive left it.

to view the project delete the HTML file outside of the public folder.
